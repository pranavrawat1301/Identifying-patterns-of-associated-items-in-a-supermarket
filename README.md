# Identifying-patterns-of-associated-items-in-a-supermarket
The project uses Association rule mining in it. Using Python, Pandas, and the Apriori algorithm, this repository preprocesses transactional data, applies Apriori for frequent itemset mining, and analyzes results. The project gives us  efficient ways to uncover hidden patterns and implement robust association rule mining techniques.
